# Apple Translate Text Animation

This morning, I came across an animation on Twitter that caught my eye. Inspired, I decided to give it a try, and just 30 minutes later, here we are. While it may not be a pixel-perfect replication of Apple's original animation, I was so happy with the result that I decided to create this repository to share it.

Take a look at the animation:
